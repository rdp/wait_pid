= wait_pid

This provides a ruby library

WaitPid.wait_pid pid_number # waits until that process exits

and also a binary command

$ wait_pid pid_number # waits until that process exits

Currently it just polls 100 times/s to see if the process is still around.  If more granularity is needed let me know [it is possible, at least in windows, or a higher polling capability could be made optional in linux].

Enjoy. Feedback welcome.
